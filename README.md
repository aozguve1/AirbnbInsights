## Key Findings

This bar chart illustrates the mean price of Airbnb listings across different neighborhoods in Boston. From the visualization, we can infer that:
- The South Boston Waterfront, Charlestown, and the West End are the most expensive neighborhoods on average.
- There is a gradual decrease in the average price as we move towards neighborhoods like Brighton, Leather District, Roxbury, and Hyde Park.
- The least expensive neighborhoods on average are Hyde Park and JP NF, which may indicate more affordable options for upcoming travelers.


The bar chart depicting the total number of reviews per neighborhood provides insights into the popularity of each area:
- Dorchester, Downtown, and the South End are the most reviewed neighborhoods, suggesting high guest traffic and popularity.
- There is a noticeable drop in reviews for neighborhoods such as Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, and South Boston, indicating moderate popularity.
- Back Bay and Beacon Hill, despite being central and historically significant areas, have fewer reviews, which could be due to higher pricing or less availability.

This heatmap shows the average price for different types of rooms across neighborhoods:

- Entire homes/apartments tend to be more expensive across all neighborhoods, with the South Boston Waterfront, Downtown, and Back Bay being the priciest.
- Private rooms are consistently more affordable, with neighborhoods like Roxbury, Mattapan, and Hyde Park offering the most economical options.
- Shared rooms are not commonly listed but are the cheapest option where available.
